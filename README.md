## GitHub Invoices

We created this to automate the process of downloading our invoices from GitHub. We thought this would reduce the amount of time it takes to do our weekly accounting task. We've since found that splitting these invoice tasks out of the main accounting task reduces the time of the accounting task without the overhead of ensuring these apps/scripts are running.

The code is in the git history but removed from master as we're no longer using it.
